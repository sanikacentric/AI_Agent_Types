Types of AI Agents and Their Behaviors
Reactive Agent

Behavior: Responds instantly to each claim without storing any prior knowledge or context.

Use Case: Fast, one-off processing where learning or memory isn't necessary.

Reflection Agent

Behavior: Remembers previously processed claims and uses this memory to improve accuracy over time.

Use Case: Ideal for scenarios where repetitive claims occur and learning from history is valuable.

ReAct Agent (Reason + Act)

Behavior: First reasons about the claim (analyzing it), then takes action based on its analysis.

Use Case: Best suited for claims that require logical breakdown before decision-making.

ReWOO Agent (Reasoning Without Observations)

Behavior: Chooses randomly between using external data (observation) or relying on internal reasoning.

Use Case: Useful for balancing internal knowledge and external data, especially when data access is inconsistent.

Deliberative Agent

Behavior: Plans a structured, step-by-step process before making a final decision.

Use Case: Great for complex claim assessments requiring multi-step evaluation.

Learning Agent

Behavior: Detects fraud patterns over time and learns from previous fraud analysis.

Use Case: Effective in environments where fraud patterns evolve and past knowledge improves detection.

Hybrid Agent

Behavior: Combines memory, reasoning, learning, and planning to handle claims in a holistic manner.

Use Case: Most powerful agent for handling dynamic, high-stakes scenarios requiring adaptability and intelligence.
